# -4-Channel-AHB-APB-DMA-Controller-RTL-Design-
This project implements a synthesizable, 4-Channel Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller in Verilog. The DMA offloads data transfer operations from the CPU, allowing high-speed Memory-to-Memory copies. It features an AMBA APB Slave interface for CPU configuration and a pipelined AMBA AHB-Lite Master interface for executing memory transfers.
